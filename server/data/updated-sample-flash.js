          "explanation": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which works by inhibiting the influx of calcium through L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle. It works as an effective medication to manage hypertension, as relaxation of smooth muscle leads to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine also works in the gastrointestinal tract, where it causes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the GI tract leading to reduced peristalsis and consequently, constipation.",

In this scenario, Mr Patel believes he has been given the wrong medication, and it is extremely important for you to take a look at the medication which was prescribed and correlate that with his prescription. In some cases, patients may believe the medication is wrong due to a different brand name or packaging, and it is crucial to assure them the medication is indeed correct if that is the case. However, if there is an error and the incorrect medication is prescribed, the pharmacist in charge should be immediately notified.",

He is currently using a 25 microgram fentanyl patch every 72 hours, but he is unable to tolerate an increased dose. The GP is considering adding a buprenorphine patch to improve pain relief.

This is a serious and life-threatening event which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain. As a person takes steroids, the adrenal glands reduce the amount of cortisol they produce and, with time, has a diminished ability to produce cortisol on demand. The risk of adrenal insufficiency occurring can last up to one year after stopping any glucocorticoid treatment and thus must be down slowly on a carefully planned weaning course. Tapering down on steroid treatments slowly allows the adrenal glands to regain their capacity to produce cortisol hormones.",
